# Library Book Analysis - Implementation Documentation

## Data Transformation Process

### Initial Data Assessment
- Checked for duplicate entries based on BookID
- Verified data types for each column
- Identified missing values or anomalies in the dataset

### Data Cleaning Steps
1. Removed duplicate BookID entries
2. Applied filter to include only books published after 2000
3. Created calculated column for borrowing frequency using the DAX expression:
   ```
   BorrowingFrequency = [TimesBorrowed] / (YEAR(TODAY()) - [PublishedYear] + 1)
   ```

### Additional Data Preparation
- Created hierarchies for time-based analysis
- Added conditional formatting for visual clarity

## Visualization Design Decisions

### Bar Chart (Top 10 Authors)
- Used a horizontal bar chart for better readability of author names
- Applied sorting by total borrowing count in descending order
- Used color intensity to highlight top performers

### Pie Chart (Genre Distribution)
- Limited color palette to maintain visual clarity
- Added data labels showing both count and percentage
- Applied hover tooltips with additional context

### Line Chart (Publication Trends)
- Added trendline to highlight overall direction
- Used markers at data points for clarity
- Included year-to-year comparison for growth analysis

### Scatter Plot (Ratings vs. Borrowing)
- Applied visual cues to identify outliers
- Used tooltips to display book titles on hover
- Added reference lines for average rating and borrowing frequency

## Interactive Features Implementation
- Created bidirectional filtering between visualizations
- Implemented bookmarks for saving specific views
- Added drill-through functionality for deeper analysis

## Performance Optimization
- Used appropriate aggregation methods
- Limited visuals per page to maintain loading speed
- Optimized DAX measures for efficiency

## Design Principles Applied
- Consistent color scheme across all visuals
- Clear labeling and titles for all elements
- White space utilization for visual separation
- Mobile-friendly layout considerations

## Challenges and Solutions
- **Challenge**: Handling books with very recent publication years that skewed borrowing frequency
- **Solution**: Added conditional logic to account for minimum time period

- **Challenge**: Visualizing genre distribution with many small categories
- **Solution**: Grouped smaller genres into "Other" category for clearer visualization

## Testing Process
- Verified calculations against sample data
- Tested cross-filtering functionality
- Validated report performance across different devices
